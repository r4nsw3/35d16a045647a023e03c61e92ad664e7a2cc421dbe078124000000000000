  |   What would you do if a stranger's fate rested in your fingertips?     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   When Quinn wakes up alone in a locked room with nothing of note       |
  |   save for a computer hooked up to an internet chat room in which       |
  |   you're present, you become his single ray of hope.                    |
  |   Your choices - and your timeliness - will single-handedly shape       |
  |   his escape efforts... or lead him down the path to an untimely end.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Clock Never Stops.                                                |

  |   STAY plays out in real-time, meaning that every minute spent away     |
  |   from the game is a minute Quinn is left alone. Drop out of            |
  |   conversations or leave Quinn to fend for himself for too long and     |
  |   there may be consequences.                                            |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Quinn is on edge, and so every response matters. Prove yourself a     |
  |   compassionate ally and he'll learn to trust you and share his         |
  |   findings and deepest thoughts. Fail, and his emotions may work        |
  |   against you.                                                          |

  |   Featuring 24 chapters, seven different endings, dozens of potential   |
  |   deaths and entire webs of conversation, STAY is designed to be        |

  |   Webcams enable you to spy on Quinn, letting you see both his          |
